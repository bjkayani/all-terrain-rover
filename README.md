# All Terrain Rover
4WD All Terrain Rover

## Description
This is my fully custom built 4WD all terrain rover with independant suspension and fpv. I built this as a platform for advanced 
all terrain robotics research. The idea is to automate robotic tasks in extreme terrain with this robot. Uptil now, I have been
able to complete the chassis and test it extensively in RC mode. Next step is to add some automation using the onboard GPS, IMU 
and Camera. I plan to add more sensors in the future including position sensors, lidar and depth cameras. 

## Project Status
Currently this project is sitting dormant, waiting for me to get the time to develop it further.
